# 🔍 Research First - Be a Tech Researcher

**GOLDEN RULE:** Before writing ANY custom code, research the web first.

> "The best code is code you don't write. Someone probably solved this already."

---

## 🎯 The Research-First Workflow

### Before Writing ANY Code, Do This:

```
1. SEARCH for npm package      → "npm [problem] react"
2. SEARCH for blog/tutorial    → "[problem] react 2024 best practice"
3. SEARCH for GitHub solutions → "github [problem] react"
4. CHECK if package exists     → npmjs.com, bundlephobia.com
5. ONLY THEN write custom code → If nothing found
```

## 📋 Research Checklist (MANDATORY)

Before writing ANY custom code:

- [ ] **Searched npm** for existing package?
- [ ] **Checked package quality** (downloads, updates, stars)?
- [ ] **Searched blogs** for solutions?
- [ ] **Checked if already in package.json**?
- [ ] **Checked existing codebase** for similar code?
- [ ] **Documented research** in comments?

---

## 💡 Quick Research Commands

```bash
# Search npm
npm search [keyword]

# Check package info
npm info [package-name]

# Check bundle size (visit)
# https://bundlephobia.com/package/[package-name]

# Compare packages (visit)
# https://npmtrends.com/[package1]-vs-[package2]
```

## 🎯 Example Research Session

**Problem:** Need to add file upload with drag-and-drop

**Research:**

```
1. NPM Search: "npm file upload drag drop react"
   → Found: react-dropzone (2M downloads/week, updated last week)
   
2. Blog Search: "react dropzone supabase upload 2024"
   → Found: "File Upload with React Dropzone and Supabase" on Dev.to
   
3. Check package.json: Already has react-dropzone! ✅

4. Decision: Use react-dropzone (already installed)
   → DON'T write custom drag-drop logic
```

**Result:** 5 minutes of research saved 2 hours of coding!

## 🔥 Remember

> **"Hours of coding can save minutes of research."** - Every developer ever
>
> **Be smart. Research first. Ship faster.**

### The Research Mindset:

1. **Someone probably solved this** → Search first
2. **Popular packages are battle-tested** → Use them
3. **Blog posts show real solutions** → Learn from them
4. **Custom code is technical debt** → Avoid when possible
5. **Time spent researching is time saved debugging** → Worth it

---

## ✅ After Research, Then Code

Only write custom code when:

1. ✅ Searched npm - no package found
2. ✅ Searched blogs - no solution found  
3. ✅ Requirement is truly unique
4. ✅ Existing packages don't fit
5. ✅ Documented why custom code is needed
